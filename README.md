# Bitcoin Arbitrage Evaluation 

---

## Use 

The purpose of this is to evaluate arbitrage opportunities between Bitcoin trades executed on two exchanges (Bitstamp & Coinbase) over a  
three month period (January - March) in 2018. Once these trades are identified, we will evaluate the profitability of the trades after filtering  
for certain criteria that allows us to remove the ones that aren't large enough to cover expenses and fees (1% return minimum).

Three days are selected for detailed analysis. These dates were selected by the most visible arbitrage opportunities from the data.

I then analyze the trade opportunities utilizing visualizations to help make sense of the data.
